If you have seen this little, yellow cartoon character, then you know what Pokemon is. That yellow little guy is Pikachu and there's a thousand more like him. In Pokemon games, you try to knock out your opponent's pokemon by attacking. Now, pokemon come in different types and a certain type is more vulnerable to atacks from another type. Be mindful of this as a strong pokemon (by Hit Points, Attack, Defense, Special Attack and Special Defense points) could suffer considerable damage from a weaker pokemon if it is more vulnerable to that pokemon type. For example, a water pokemon's attack could be twice as destructive to a fire pokemon. [Learn more about types and vulnerabilities](https://www.theloadout.com/pokemon-type-chart

### **A PRIMER ON POKEMON STATS**
Pokemon have stats that characterize how generally weak or strong they are
#### **HP**
The hitpoints represents the number of hits a pokemon can take before it faints and goes out of battle. The Higher the hitpoints, the more damages it can take before it faints. Think of it as a longer life span.
#### **ATTACK**
This represents how devastating an attack from the pokemon is.
#### **SPECIAL ATTACK**
The special attack delivers more damage but it is fueled by continously using the normal attacks. Be careful, using your special attack can leave your pokemon dizzy and unable to react quickly, you'd want to use it for a finisher, once your opponent's HP has dropped considerably.
#### **DEFENCE**
The higher the defence, the more resistant it is to attacks. A pokemon can have good defence but low HP. If that pokemon gets a good blow, it's off. You'll want a pokemon that has good defences and HP. because damages to HP are calculated by a ratio of attack to defence, a reasonably high defence is good enough.
#### **SPECIAL DEFENCE**
This gives the pokemon more resistance to attacks when used
#### **SPEED**
The faster pokemon attacks first.
